# 🏋️ Smart Personalized Fitness Training System

A full-stack web application that dynamically builds personalized fitness programs using a smart algorithm.  
Workouts are generated based on user age, time availability, preferred styles, and workout history.

## 🧠 How It Works

When a user starts a new training session, they select:
- ⏱️ Desired workout duration
- 💪 Preferred training styles (e.g., cardio, strength, mobility)
- 👤 Personal data (including age)

The system uses a dynamic algorithm to generate a personalized workout, taking into account:
- Exercises that were skipped recently
- Exercises previously failed or ignored
- User preferences
- A balanced variety of styles
